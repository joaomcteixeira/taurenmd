# v2.0.0

Improves and establishes general architecture and design [#5](https://github.com/joaomcteixeira/Tauren-MD/pull/5):

- function argument input is validated via decorators.
- in order to allow compatibility with future implementations:
    - all functions receive *argsand **kwargsparameters,
    - functions return (traj, ) tuple.
- corrected implementation errors, for example, checking argument validity via assert.
- improved library organization and names.
- adopts usage of f-strings.
- improves implementation of some functions.
- improves logging configuration and messages systemwide.
- adds VISION: problem identification, solution and implementation.
- adds CHANGE_LOG.

# v1.0.1

- Updates installer [#2](https://github.com/joaomcteixeira/Tauren-MD/pull/2)

# v1.0.0

I actually don't like versions 0 `:-)`
v1 is a simple yet production ready version, though open to refactor and redesign.
